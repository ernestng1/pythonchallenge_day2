<h1>Day 2 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 2 challenge, I created a simple Tip Calcultor project that collects input on your food bill, amount of tip that you would like to give and number of people who are eating the meal. The code then outputs the amount that each person has to pay! This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>arithmetic operation</li>
  <li>data types</li>
  <li>number manipulation</li>
  <li>F strings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
Unfortunately, I didn't manage to do this challenge consecutively due to my work commitments. I guess I will try to work around this by working on more exercises/challenges over the weekends!

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>

<h2>You can join me too!</h2>
